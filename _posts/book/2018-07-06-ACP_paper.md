# Ice-nucleating

Short Summary: The coupled system of the Manchester Aerosol Chamber and Manchester Ice Cloud Chamber was used to study the ice-forming abilities of secondary organic aerosol particles under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Given the vast abundance of secondary organic particles in the atmosphere, they might present an important contribution to ice-nucleating particles. However, we find that in the studied temperature range (20 to 28 oC) the secondary organic particles do not nucleate ice particles.

Short Summary: We present the first comparison of columnar aerosol properties recorded by sun photometry of Saharan dust between western Africa and Caribbean Basin. A comprehensive climatology of 20 years of data is presented in the two areas. To our knowledge, we present the first global climatology of columnar aerosols in the Caribbean Basin. Changes after transport in aerosol load, size distribution, shape, and absorbing and scattering variables are quantified using long-term records between 1996 and 2014.
