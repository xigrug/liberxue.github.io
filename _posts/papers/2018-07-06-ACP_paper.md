# Ice-nucleating

> * The efficiency of secondary organic aerosol particles acting as ice-nucleating particles under mixed-phase cloud conditions

Short Summary: The coupled system of the Manchester Aerosol Chamber and Manchester Ice Cloud Chamber was used to study the ice-forming abilities of secondary organic aerosol particles under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Given the vast abundance of secondary organic particles in the atmosphere, they might present an important contribution to ice-nucleating particles. However, we find that in the studied temperature range (20 to 28 oC) the secondary organic particles do not nucleate ice particles.

## transport

> * Impact of long-range transport over the Atlantic Ocean on Saharan dust optical and microphysical properties based on AERONET data

Short Summary: We present the first comparison of columnar aerosol properties recorded by sun photometry of Saharan dust between western Africa and Caribbean Basin. A comprehensive climatology of 20 years of data is presented in the two areas. To our knowledge, we present the first global climatology of columnar aerosols in the Caribbean Basin. Changes after transport in aerosol load, size distribution, shape, and absorbing and scattering variables are quantified using long-term records between 1996 and 2014.

## profile

The diurnal cycle of cloud profiles over land and ocean between 51° S and 51° N, seen by the CATS spaceborne lidar from the International Space Station

Short Summary: From 3 years of observations from the CATS lidar on the International Space Station we document the daily cycle of the vertical distribution of clouds. 
This is the first time this is documented over several continents and oceans using finely resolved measurements on a near-global scale from a single instrument. 
We show that other instruments observing clouds from space, like CALIPSO, document extremes of the daily cycle over ocean and closer to the average over land.
